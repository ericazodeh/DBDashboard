Phase 4 README:

Contains Action.java, Dashboard.java,graphviz.java,DevLog.txt, and 4 PNG images.
Click on the PNG images to see the XChart display of the graph
TO USE THE "Query Functions" BUTTON, YOU MUST RUN ACTION.JAVA 
Running only Dashboard.java will not allow you to jump to the Phase 3 functions
so make sure to run Action.java which will incorporate both the dashboard and the query functions!
